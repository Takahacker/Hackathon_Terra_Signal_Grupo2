The DSL internet is reliable and I have had no issues with connectivity. The monthly charges of $68.75 are reasonable for the service I receive. I appreciate the convenience of paying with electronic check. Overall, I am happy with my experience and have no plans to switch providers.",
         "I've been a customer with this company for over 2 and a half years now, and unfortunately I have decided to churn. The DSL internet service was reliable for the most part, but the monthly charges of $73.9 were a bit steep for the quality of service I was receiving. Additionally, having to mail in a check for payment was inconvenient and outdated. I ultimately decided to switch to a different provider that offered better value and more modern payment options.",
         "I have been a customer with this company for 22 months now and I have been satisfied with the service. I have not experienced any issues with billing or service interruptions. The monthly charges are affordable at $20.05 and I appreciate being able to pay by mailing a check. The lack of internet service is not a problem for me as I do not require it. Overall, I am happy with my experience as a customer and have no complaints.",
         "I have been a customer with this internet provider for 28 months now and I have been very satisfied with the service. The monthly charges are reasonable at $35.9 and I appreciate the convenience of paying with electronic check. The DSL internet service has been reliable and I have not experienced any issues with connectivity. Overall, I am happy with my experience and have no plans to switch providers.",
         "I have been using the fiber optic internet service for the past 2 months and I am very satisfied with the speed and reliability. The monthly charges of $70.3 are reasonable for the quality of service I am receiving. The electronic check payment method is convenient and hassle-free. Overall, I have had a positive experience with the service and have no plans to switch providers."
